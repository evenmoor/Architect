# Architect 1.6
-----

Architect is an open source CMS based on PHP and MySQL intended for use on small websites. It was designed from the ground up to work with responsive site templates and includes an editor which allows inline page editing at preview resolutions.

This version of Architect is depricated and is to be replaced by Architect 2.0. These files are being retained for posterity.
